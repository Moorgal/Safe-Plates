Our mission is to help people with food allergies and intolerances find recipes that cater to their unique dietary needs and preferences and discover restaurants that serve dishes in line with their preferred cuisine and diet.

## Description

For individuals with food allergies and intolerances, every meal can feel like a lottery with unknown consequences. From light allergies to stomach discomfort and even the risk of anaphylactic shock, the dangers associated with consuming the wrong foods can be severe.
